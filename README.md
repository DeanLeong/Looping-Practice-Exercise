# Morning Exercise

### Complete your work in exercise.js

#### Exercise 1
1. Declare a variable called `temp` and set it to 32.
1. Write an if statement and determine a condition where:
  - If the temp is less than or equal to 32, write to the console "Watch out for ice".
  - If the temp is between 33 and 55, write to the console "Better put on a jacket"
  - If the temp is between 56 and 70, write to the console "Such nice weather we're having"
  - If the temp is between 71 and 99, write to the console "Summer is here"
  - If the temp is either 212 or 444, write to the console "Where are you exactly?"
  - Finally, if the temp is above 99 write "Global Warming!"

#### Exercise 2

1. Declare a variable called `time` and get the current date (you may need to research the Date method on MDN or W3Schools).
1. **Get** the current month written to the console and note its return value.
1. How can we make it reflect the current months' number?
1. Set a new variable called `currentMonth` and set it equal to a ternary operator that determines if  `time` equals 1. If true, have the statement return 'It is January' and 'It isn't January', if false.
1. How can we include an apostrophe in a string with single quotes? (you may need to research this).
